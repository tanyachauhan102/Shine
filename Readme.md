X Education gets a lots of Leads through Marketing and Referrals. But the conversion rate of these leads to take a course is very poor. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%. Company wants us to help them select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires you to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with a higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.
